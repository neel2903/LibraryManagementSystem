Functional Requirements for a Library Management System
The following are the functional requirements for a Library Management System:

1.Ability to add and remove books from the library
2.Ability to search for books in the library by title, author, or ISBN
3.Ability to check out and return books
4.Ability to display a list of all books in the library
5.Ability to store and retrieve information about library patrons, including their name and ID number
6.Ability to track which books are currently checked out and when they are due to be returned
7.Ability to generate reports on library usage and checkouts



Non-Functional Requirements for a Library Management System
The following are the non-functional requirements for a Library Management System:

1.User-friendly interface for easy navigation and use
2.High performance and scalability to handle large amounts of data
3.Data security and protection to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of library patrons and their information
4.Compatibility with various operating systems and devices
5.Ability to handle multiple users and concurrent access to the system
6.Compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding library management and data privacy
7.Regular updates and maintenance to ensure the system remains functional and secure over time.



Entities for a Library Management System
The following are the entities for a Library Management System:

1.Book: Each book in the library is represented by a Book entity.
2.Library: The collection of books in the library is represented by the Library entity.
3.Patron: Each library patron is represented by a Patron entity.
4.Checkout: Each checkout transaction is represented by a Checkout entity.


Low-Level Design of Library Management System Classes and Methods Involved
Low-level design for a library management system in C++ would involve creating classes and functions to handle the various operations and data required for the system. Here is an example of how the system could be designed:

1.Book Class: This class would store information about a single book, such as its title, author, ISBN number, and availability status. It would also include functions to check out and return a book.
2.Library Class: This class would store a collection of books and handle operations such as adding and removing books, searching for books, and displaying the list of books.
3.Patron Class: This class would store information about library patrons, such as their names and ID numbers. It would also include functions to check out and return books.
4.Checkout Class: This class would handle the checking out and returning of books. It would store information about which patron has checked out which book and when it is due to be returned.
5.main() function: This function would be responsible for creating objects of the Library, Book, Patron, and Checkout classes and calling the appropriate functions to carry out the library management tasks.





Conclusion
In conclusion, designing a Library Management System involves several steps that include:

1.Gathering Requirements: Identifying the needs and expectations of the stakeholders such as librarians, library members, and library administrators.
2.Identifying Entities and Relationships: Identifying the entities such as books, authors, members, and loans and their relationships in the system.
3.Visualizing System Architecture: Creating a class diagram or an entity-relationship diagram to visualise the relationships between the entities.
4.Breaking down the system into smaller modules: Creating a high-level architecture of the system by dividing it into smaller modules such as books, members, and loans.
5.Creating Class Diagrams: For each module, create a detailed class diagram and identify the methods and attributes of the classes.
6.Identifying Functionalities: For each module, list the major functionalities that need to be implemented.
7.Identifying Data Structures and Algorithms: Identifying the data structures and algorithms that need to be used to implement the functionalities.
8.Choosing Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries: Finally, mention the technologies, frameworks, and libraries that will be used to implement the system.
